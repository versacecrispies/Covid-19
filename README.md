# Covid-19
An attempt to bring about better accuracy to pre-existing ideas and projects centered around detecting Covid-19 through chest X-Rays through deep learning. I used an InceptionV3 model to train on the images and got 100% accuracy for detecting both Covid-19 positive and Covid-19 negative chest X-Rays. The statistics can be found in the classification report and confusion matrix.
